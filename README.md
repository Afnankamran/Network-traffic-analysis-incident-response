# Network-traffic-analysis-incident-response

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing network traffic to detect anomalies and respond to incidents effectively. It involves simulating various cyber-attacks, capturing and analyzing traffic, and implementing incident response measures.

**Objectives**

Simulate network attacks such as port scanning, ARP spoofing, and DNS poisoning.

Capture and analyze network traffic to identify patterns and anomalies.

Implement and document incident response strategies.

**Tools Used**

Packet Capture & Analysis: Wireshark, TCPDump

Attack Simulation: Nmap, Metasploit

Detection & Logging: Snort, Zeek

Reporting: Markdown (for documentation)

Steps to Get Started

Set Up the Environment:

Install VirtualBox/VMware.

Configure virtual machines (Kali Linux for attack simulation, Ubuntu as the target).

Install Necessary Tools:

Set up tools like Wireshark, TCPDump, Nmap, Metasploit, Snort, and Zeek.

Simulate Attacks:

Perform port scanning, ARP spoofing, and DNS poisoning.

Analyze Network Traffic:

Capture packets using TCPDump/Wireshark and analyze them for anomalies.

Document Findings:

Record analysis results and incident response measures.


How to Use

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-traffic-analysis-incident-response.git

Follow the setup guides in the setup/ directory.

Execute the attack simulations and analyze the results.
